I'm a self-taught software developer and the journey have been quite nice. 

I'm a secondary school computer science teacher who decided to become a software engineer.

I played with Java, Python and learnt some basics of deep learning and AI. I decided to land on web development because I love crafting and bulding things up.

I design and develop web apps, both backend and frontend and also test them end-to-end. 

I'm currently working on an e-commerce website and trying make practice all what i've been learning so far.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects with the MERN stack.

ðŸ¤” I'm looking at becoming good at software design to solve the problems people have in my community.

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning frontend and backend test and TDD
- Pronouns: He/Him
